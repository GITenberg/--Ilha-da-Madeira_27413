<h1>Á ILHA DA MADEIRA</h1>

<blockquote>
  Ao nauta que do mar tempestuoso<br>
  Vem dos baldões asperrimos cansado,<br>
  Tu te mostras, ó ilha feiticeira,<br>
  Como, depois de somno fadigoso<br>
        De horriveis pezadellos,<br>
        Um dia delicioso,<br>
  Todo alegria e festa e raios bellos,<br>
  Um claro dia pelo sol doirado.</blockquote>

<blockquote>
        Se isto é hoje d'est'arte,<br>
        O que seria d'antes,<br>
  Quando te desvendaste a vez primeira<br>
  Da nevoa e do mysterio em grande parte<br>
  Á vista dos pasmados navegantes!<br>
  Que, não bastando ainda estar perdida<br>
        No meio do oceano,<br>
  Por seculos dos homens escondida<br>
        Em recondito arcano,<br>
  Tu, qual donzella candida e medrosa,<br>
        Que do banho sahisse,<br>
        E a nudez, vergonhosa,<br>
        De alvo cendal cobrisse,<br>
  Em manto de neblina te embuçavas:<br>
  E até do mar, que ás plantas te gemia,<br>
  E até do proprio sol, que te queria,<br>
  A virgem formosura recatavas.</blockquote>

<blockquote>
        Porêm chegou o dia<br>
        Pelo Eterno marcado,<br>
        Em que, apezar d'esquiva,<br>
        Te rendeste captiva<br>
  Do sol da nossa gloria á viva chamma,<br>
        Ao generoso brado<br>
  Do grande Henrique de perpetua fama,<br>
  Quando, assim como do Sinai o monte,<br>
  Sagres de raios coroou a fronte,<br>
        E, desmedido pharo,<br>
        Ao marinheiro ignaro<br>
  Fez dissipar as trevas do horizonte.</blockquote>

<blockquote>
        Pandas as brancas velas,<br>
  Atravessadas pela cruz de Christo,<br>
        Eis no liquido argento<br>
  As fortes, portuguezas caravellas<br>
  Correm ao sopro do inconstante vento.<br>
  Assim na edade-media a Europa ha visto,<br>
  Assignalados por egual emblema,<br>
        Passarem os guerreiros<br>
  Á Asia, para em rabido combate<br>
        De annos e annos inteiros<br>
  Dar ao sagrado tumulo o resgate.<br>
        É o mesmo o nosso thema:<br>
  A fé; tambem o oriente procuramos,<br>
  E, como elles, tambem a amiga espada,<br>
  A par da cruz, intrepidos levamos<br>
        A uma outra cruzada.</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  Ruem os furacões; troam os ares;<br>
  É plumbeo o céo; das lobregas entranhas,<br>
        Quaes liquidas montanhas,<br>
  Volvem-se em desespero os torvos mares.<br>
        Pelas ondas corridos,<br>
  Os pequenos baixeis tragam a morte,<br>
        Já quasi submergidos;<br>
  Porêm não desanima a gente forte.<br>
  Invoca a soberana potestade,<br>
  Que a protege de ha muito, e a praia ignota,<br>
  Na escura cerração da tempestade,<br>
  Compadecida, lhe dirige a rota.</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  Alçando as mãos a Deus, inda molhadas<br>
        Das ondas salitrosas,<br>
  A maritima turba lh'agradece<br>
        As terras deparadas,<br>
  As vidas tanto a pique assim poupadas,<br>
        Com palavras piedosas,<br>
        E murmura esta prece:</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  Senhor, se, como outrora do teu povo<br>
  Os passos pelo ermo encaminhaste,<br>
  A este porto santo nos guiaste,<br>
  Dá-nos, dá-nos ainda um signal novo,<br>
  Outro maior signal de teus favores;<br>
        Teus filhos tambem somos;<br>
        Ás asperas fadigas,<br>
  Ao bravo pego, ás armas inimigas<br>
  Por ti só, pela patria nos expomos;<br>
  Faze que esta primeira descoberta,<br>
  Que o dom d'esta ilha esteril e deserta<br>
  Seja seguido d'outros dons melhores.</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  Dizem; abaixam da cerulea altura<br>
  Os olhos; e, ao baixal-os, de repente<br>
  Vêem longe sahir de nevoa escura,<br>
  Que mais e mais se torna transparente,<br>
  Uma visão da phantazia ardente?<br>
  De um monte a sobranceira catadura?</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  Eia; ao mar; o Senhor nos presta ouvidos;<br>
  Temos fé que é verdade essa apparencia,<br>
  Não devaneio apenas dos sentidos.<br>
        É da sua clemencia<br>
  Quem sabe se o signal; ao mar corramos.<br>
  Bradam; soltam ao vento a larga vela;<br>
  Já chegam; já de todo a alva neblina<br>
  Aqui, ali, se esvae ou se adelgaça,<br>
  E mostra, meio occultos, com mais graça,<br>
  Flores, verdura, emmaranhados ramos,<br>
        Uma terra tão bella,<br>
  Que mais semelha apparição divina,<br>
  Ou cahida do céo fulgida estrella.</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  Assim aos denodados portuguezes<br>
  Appareceste, ó ilha da Madeira,<a name="tex2html1"
  href="#foot42"><sup>1</sup></a><br>
  Para os avigorares nos revezes;<br>
  Assim aos olhos de Noé outrora,<br>
        Depois das grandes aguas,<br>
  Appareceu o arco da alliança,<br>
  Entre elle e Deus, o iris da bonança,<br>
  Que do diluvio o confortou nas maguas.<br>
        Sim, tu foste a esperança,<br>
  Que Deus, á nossa empreza favoravel,<br>
  Nos amostrou para nos dar alentos,<br>
  E, atravez do luctar dos elementos,<br>
  Cumprirmos nosso fado incomparavel.<br>
  D'aqui, cheios de arrojo, nós partimos,<br>
  E d'Asia, e d'Africa e do Novo Mundo<br>
  Em grande parte as plagas descobrimos,<br>
        E pelo pégo fundo<br>
  Em roda o globo co'os baixeis medimos.</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  Como és bella! Da Grecia conhecida,<br>
  Tu serias de Venus a morada,<br>
  Ou fôra, ao ver-te assim do mar sahida,<br>
  A nascença de Venus fabulada.<br>
  Ficara a téla dos Jardins d'Armida,<br>
  Sendo feita por ti, mais bem pintada,<br>
  E a descripção da Ilha dos Amores<br>
  Realçariam mais os teus primores.</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  Todos, á uma, os povos te namoram;<br>
  Mas a todos te mostras insensivel.<br>
  Embalde os filhos de Albion te exoram,<br>
  Te chamam Flor do Oceano immarcescivel.<br>
  Nossos antigos os primeiros foram;<br>
  Por outrem nos deixar não te é possivel.<br>
  Do céo, dos mares e de Deus á face<br>
  De nós comtigo se firmou o enlace.</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  Por seres tão fiel, tão portugueza<br>
  Mais ainda te estimo, ilha formosa;<br>
  Mas por laço diverso anda a ti presa<br>
  Minh'alma: da existencia trabalhosa<br>
  Com risos esmaltaste-me a tristeza,<br>
  Na quadra, embora amarga, descuidosa<br>
  Da passada, inexperta juventude,<br>
  Quando uns dias viver em ti eu pude.</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  E agora que de ti me tem distante<br>
  O logar e dos annos a carreira,<br>
  Phantaziu-te ainda mais brilhante,<br>
  Vejo-te mais ainda feiticeira,<br>
  Que me recorda teu florir constante<br>
  A minha primavera passageira,<br>
  A minha tão querida mocidade,<br>
  E és para mim um echo, uma saudade.</blockquote>

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
